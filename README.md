Trailblazer : Personal Project by Joel Ye

Mapmaking applet for local GPS
Extending into app for mobile use
Applies to places with billboard maps (add a QR to download map!)

Notes:
Flask Routing Engine
SQLAlchemy/Postgresql Backend
Bootstrap/JS Frontend

Notes for the future:
- Focus on image upload first!
- Let user mark vector elements as nodes
- Paths are still edges as usual
- Connections should be able to have >= 2 degree
- Use libraries to speed up DOM editing
